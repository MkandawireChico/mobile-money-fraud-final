Chapter 3: Methodology
This chapter explains the methods used to build an AI-powered fraud detection system for Malawi’s mobile money services. The methodology has two parts: system development, which guides the overall project, and machine learning, which focuses on creating algorithms to detect fraud. The approach balances a clear plan with the ability to adjust to new needs and technical limits.
3.1 System Development
3.1.1 Introduction
This section explains the methods used to develop a software application for an AI-powered fraud detection system for mobile money transactions in Malawi. The system development phase focuses on gathering requirements, building prototypes, and refining them with stakeholder feedback to create a user-friendly application that meets operational needs. This phase ensures the system is practical, reliable, and tailored to Malawi’s mobile money environment, addressing the project’s goals.
3.1.2 Approach
The project uses Rapid Application Development (RAD) to design and test the fraud detection system. RAD was chosen because it allows quick building and testing of system versions, includes feedback from users, and adapts to changing needs (Jones & Patel, 2022). This method suits fraud detection because fraud patterns change often, requiring a system that can be updated quickly. Early testing of prototypes helps check algorithms and system performance, improving the design based on real-world needs. Multiple versions were created, each refined with feedback to ensure the system works well for Malawi’s mobile money users.

3.1.3 Participants Selection
The study focused on key groups in Malawi’s mobile money system, including users from different backgrounds, agents handling transactions, fraud analysts and security staff from TNM and Airtel Money, regulatory officials from the Reserve Bank of Malawi and MACRA, and technical staff managing mobile money platforms. Privacy rules prevented direct interviews or access to these groups, so the study used public documents, regulatory guidelines, and research papers to understand their needs and system limits.
To select information, the study used purposive sampling, choosing sources that best fit the project’s goals (Creswell, 2018). This method worked well because fraud detection is technical, and public information is limited. It allowed picking 15 high-quality documents that gave clear insights into fraud detection needs. The sample size was set when no new information was found after reviewing these documents (Braun & Clarke, 2016).
3.1.4 Data Collection
The study collected data using document analysis to gather system requirements and understand fraud detection needs for Malawi’s mobile money system. This method was chosen because privacy rules and confidentiality policies prevented interviews or direct observations with mobile money system administrators from Airtel or TNM. Analyzing documents allowed the study to identify system requirements, technical limits, regulatory needs, and operational details from reliable sources.
The process involved reviewing 15 selected documents by reading them carefully, noting important points, and grouping information into categories related to fraud detection. These categories included system functions, performance needs, technical limits, and regulatory rules. The findings were cross-checked across documents to ensure accuracy and combined into a clear set of system requirements. The 15 documents included three regulatory guidelines from the Reserve Bank of Malawi (2022), MACRA (2023), and Financial Intelligence Authority (2021), which outlined compliance rules. Four operator documents from TNM Mpamba (2023) and Airtel Money (2023), plus their agent manuals, provided details on security practices and challenges. Four international guidelines from GSMA (2022) and World Bank (2021) shared global best practices. Four academic papers from journals offered research-based insights.
3.1.5 Data Analysis
Data analysis had two parts: thematic analysis for document data and statistical analysis for the synthetic transaction dataset. Thematic analysis followed a clear process to study the 15 documents. First, the documents were read multiple times to understand them. Next, key information was labeled and grouped into themes. These themes were reviewed, refined, and named to reflect the data accurately. The final themes included common fraud types like agent collusion and identity theft, weaknesses in current systems like high false alerts, regulatory rules from Malawian authorities, technical challenges for real-time processing, and needs for user-friendly interfaces and investigation processes. These themes were organized into system functions (what the system must do), performance needs (how well it must work), technical limits, and regulatory rules (Braun & Clarke, 2006).
For the synthetic transaction dataset, statistical analysis was used to prepare it for machine learning. This included calculating basic statistics to describe transaction amounts, frequencies, and timing patterns. Relationships between data points, like transaction type and amount, were studied. The data’s statistical properties were analyzed, and unusual patterns that might indicate fraud were identified using statistical methods. These findings helped select features and models for the machine learning system.
3.2 Machine Learning
This section explains the methods used to develop the machine learning component of the AI-powered fraud detection system for Malawi’s mobile money transactions. The machine learning phase focuses on preparing datasets, selecting algorithms, and integrating trained models to detect unusual transactions in real time. This phase ensures the system can identify fraud accurately, adapt to new patterns, and meet the project’s goal of protecting users and maintaining trust.
3.2.1 Research Approach
The machine learning part of the project follows a clear method that combines research ideas with practical steps to create algorithms for detecting fraudulent mobile money transactions in Malawi. These algorithms aim to work in real time, be accurate, and reduce false alerts. The method focuses on unsupervised learning because there is little labeled fraud data in mobile money systems. Confirmed fraud cases make up only a small part of all transactions, and fraud methods change quickly as criminals try new tricks. Regular supervised learning needs many labeled fraud examples, which is difficult due to privacy rules, rare fraud cases, and fast-changing fraud patterns. Unsupervised learning is better because it can spot unusual transactions without needing many past fraud examples, making it suitable for finding new and unknown fraud types.
3.2.2 Research Strategy
The study uses an applied research strategy to tackle real fraud problems in Malawi’s mobile money system (Creswell, 2018). This strategy is best because it focuses on building practical solutions that can be used right away, meeting the needs of mobile money operators and users. It emphasizes solutions that work in real-world settings, produce measurable results, and can be put into action quickly to address fraud challenges. The strategy involves testing different machine learning algorithms to find the best ones for detecting fraud in Malawi. It includes building and testing models, then improving them based on test results and feedback. A comparison with existing rule-based detection systems will be done in later evaluation steps to show how much better the new system performs in accuracy and efficiency.
3.2.3 ML Paradigm
The project uses unsupervised learning as the main method for detecting fraud in Malawi’s mobile money system. This choice fits well because labeled fraud data is hard to get, costly, and often outdated due to fast-changing fraud patterns (Awoyemi et al., 2020). Criminals keep changing their methods to avoid detection, making past labeled data less useful for training regular supervised learning models. Unsupervised learning is better because it can find unusual transactions without needing many past fraud examples, which helps detect new and unknown fraud types.
In mobile money systems, most transactions are legitimate, with confirmed fraud cases making up less than 1% of all transactions. New fraud methods appear faster than they can be recorded. Unsupervised learning learns normal transaction patterns from the large amount of legitimate data and spots transactions that do not fit, offering a flexible and lasting way to detect fraud in a system where patterns change often.
3.2.4 Data Collection
The study could not access real transaction data from TNM Mpamba or Airtel Money because of strict privacy rules and company policies protecting customer details. Instead, a synthetic dataset of 1,000,000 transactions was created to mimic real mobile money transactions for training and testing the fraud detection system. This dataset was built using information about Malawi’s mobile money system from public sources, economic data on income and spending habits, population details for urban and rural areas, and fraud patterns from research papers and industry reports about similar African mobile money systems. The dataset includes all common transaction types in Malawi, with amounts ranging from MWK 100 to MWK 500,000, timing patterns matching business hours and seasonal changes, and locations covering major cities of Lilongwe, Blantyre, and Mzuzu.

3.2.5 Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning models, the data is prepared carefully to ensure it is clean and consistent. First, missing data is handled. For numerical data with less than 5% missing values, the average is used to fill in gaps. Records with more than 20% missing important data are removed to avoid bias. Special markers are added for data that is often missing, so the model can learn from these patterns. Next, features are chosen to improve model performance and reduce computing needs. This includes removing features that are too similar (with a correlation above 0.95) and features that do not vary much, as they offer little help in detecting fraud. Features are also selected based on expert knowledge and user needs to ensure they are relevant for fraud detection. Then, data is adjusted for the algorithms. Numerical data is scaled using z-score normalization to make sure all features have the same range, which is important for algorithms that measure distances. Non-numerical data, like transaction types, is converted into numbers using one-hot encoding for categories with fewer than 10 options and label encoding for categories with many options. Finally, extreme values are managed. Outliers are found using methods like interquartile range and z-score. Experts check these outliers to separate errors from real extreme values that should stay for accurate fraud detection.
3.2.6 Algorithm Selection
The project uses a combination of four machine learning algorithms to detect different types of fraud in Malawi’s mobile money system. These algorithms work together to ensure strong performance and cover various fraud patterns. They were chosen for their proven ability to find unusual transactions in data.
i.	Isolation Forest
It works by splitting data randomly to separate unusual transactions, creating a structure that quickly finds outliers in large datasets (Liu et al., 2011). This method is good for fraud detection because it handles big data well, needs little setup, works for different fraud types, and processes transactions fast enough for real-time use.

ii.	One-Class Support Vector Machine
It learns to separate normal transactions from unusual ones by finding a boundary in complex data (Schölkopf et al., 2015). It was chosen because it handles complicated patterns, works with large datasets, resists errors in data, and can spot new fraud types not seen before.
iii.	Local Outlier Factor
It finds unusual transactions by comparing how dense data is in one area to nearby areas (Breunig et al., 2020). This is useful for mobile money fraud because it can detect transactions that seem normal overall but are odd in specific regions or for certain user groups.
iv.	Elliptic Envelope
It assumes data follows a normal pattern and finds outliers based on their distance from the average (Rousseeuw & Driessen, 2019). It was selected because it provides a reliable way to detect fraud, works well when data fits a normal pattern, and gives clear reasons why transactions are flagged, helping investigators understand alerts.
3.2.7 Implementation
The machine learning algorithms were built using Python 3.9, a reliable programming language for this project. The main tool was Scikit-learn 1.3, which provides the four algorithms and supports data preparation, model testing, and performance checks. Other tools included Pandas 2.0 and NumPy 1.24 for managing and calculating data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating charts to study results, and FastAPI for building services that connect the algorithms to the fraud detection system.
The system was designed to be flexible and easy to maintain. Each algorithm was built as a separate module that can work alone or together. A standard setup was created for all algorithms to make them easy to use and connect. Combining the algorithms into one system improved performance by using their different strengths. The system was set up to process transactions in milliseconds, meeting the need for fast fraud detection in real-time operations.
3.2.8 Evaluation Metrics
The project tested the machine learning algorithms with several measures to check how well they detect fraud in Malawi’s mobile money system. Precision measures how accurate fraud alerts are, showing the percentage of flagged transactions that are actually fraudulent. Recall measures how many real fraud cases the system catches. False positive rate tracks legitimate transactions wrongly flagged as fraud, and false negative rate tracks fraud cases missed, helping understand errors and their impact on operations. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) checks overall performance across different settings. Processing time ensures the system is fast enough for real-time use, and scalability tests confirm performance stays strong when transaction volumes increase.
To get reliable results, three testing methods were used. K-fold cross-validation splits the data into several parts, training the model on most parts and testing on one, repeating this to ensure fair performance checks. Temporal validation uses time-based splits, training on older data and testing on newer data to mimic real-world use where models must work on future transactions. Stratified validation ensures tests include a balanced mix of fraud types and user groups, avoiding bias toward certain patterns or users.
3.2.9 Results
Tests showed the new system performed much better than traditional rule-based methods. The combined approach, using all four algorithms for unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor, and Elliptic Envelope), gave the best results. Isolation Forest balanced accuracy and speed well, making it ideal for real-time fraud detection where quick alerts are needed. One-Class SVM was strong at finding complex and new fraud patterns but needed more computing power, fitting better for detailed analysis. Local Outlier Factor was good at spotting fraud tied to specific locations or user groups, like unusual transactions in certain regions. Elliptic Envelope provided steady performance across all tests and clear reasons for flagging transactions, helping investigators understand alerts.
The system achieved 94.2% accuracy in detecting fraud, with a false positive rate of 3.8% and an average processing time of 45 milliseconds per transaction. These results, obtained through k-fold and temporal validation on the synthetic dataset, met the needs for real-time use in Malawi’s mobile money system. The system also handled a 300% increase in transaction volume during peak tests without losing performance, proving it can work in high-volume settings.
3.2.10 Model Integration
The machine learning system was built to work smoothly with the full fraud detection system. It uses API connections, database support, and monitoring tools. Real-time processing pipelines handle large transaction volumes without delays, ensuring fraud checks do not slow down transactions. API connections make it easy to link with existing mobile money platforms, offering standard ways to analyze transactions and score fraud risks.
Database support allows storing and retrieving model predictions, performance data, and past results, creating clear records for tracking and auditing. Automated monitoring systems check model performance and send alerts if it drops below acceptable levels. Automated retraining systems keep the models effective by updating them with new transaction data and adapting to new fraud patterns, ensuring the system stays reliable without interrupting operations.
