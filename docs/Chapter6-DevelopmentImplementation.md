## 6.3 Database Implementation

The database provides data management for real-time transaction processing, historical analysis, and regulatory compliance using PostgreSQL. The design follows third normal form principles to eliminate redundancy while maintaining referential integrity through constraint enforcement and foreign key relationships.

### 6.3.1 Core Database Tables

**Users Table**: Manages system access with unique identifiers, username/email fields with unique constraints, secure password hash storage, role-based access control fields, and temporal tracking for audit trails.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'analyst',
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Transactions Table**: Central repository for mobile money transaction data with comprehensive participant information, high-precision decimal amounts, transaction classifications, temporal data, geographic information, and ML risk scores.

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    recipient_id VARCHAR(255),
    amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    location_city VARCHAR(100),
    risk_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 0.00,

**Case Reviews Table**: Manages fraud investigation workflows with assignment tracking, status progression, and decision recording.

### 6.3.2 Data Integrity and Performance

**Referential Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure proper relationships between users and activities, transactions and reviews, maintaining data consistency.

**Indexing Strategy**: Optimized indexes on frequently queried fields (transaction timestamps, user IDs, risk scores) support efficient query processing for high-volume operations.

**Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, query optimization, and strategic caching improve response times for real-time fraud detection requirements.

## 6.4 Backend Development

The backend provides API services for business logic, data processing, and system integration using Node.js Express framework. The architecture emphasizes modular service design, comprehensive error handling, and standardized response formats for consistent client integration.

### 6.4.1 Core API Controllers

**Authentication Controller**: Manages user access control with login endpoints that validate credentials and generate JWT tokens, user registration with security policy enforcement, secure logout procedures, and profile management endpoints.

```javascript
// Transaction fraud prediction endpoint
app.post('/api/transactions/predict/:transaction_id', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const fraudDetectionService = new FraudDetectionService(anomalyService);
        const result = await fraudDetectionService.checkTransaction(req.params.transaction_id);
        res.json(result);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
    }
});
```

**Transaction Controller**: Provides transaction management with retrieval endpoints supporting filtering, pagination, and sorting. Includes detailed analysis endpoints integrating ML predictions with business rule evaluation, and transaction status management for workflow tracking.

**Case Review Controller**: Manages fraud investigation workflows with case retrieval, assignment filtering, status tracking, decision recording, and investigation notes management for collaborative processes.

**ML Service Integration**: Provides real-time fraud prediction through endpoints that process transaction features and return risk assessments, with error handling and fallback procedures for system availability.

### 6.4.2 Security and Access Control

**Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical role definitions with administrative privileges for system management, analyst permissions for investigation activities, and appropriate permission assignment.

```javascript
// Role-based middleware implementation
const requireRole = (roles) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
        }
        next();
    };
};

// Admin-only routes
app.use('/api/users', requireRole(['admin']));
// Admin and analyst routes
app.use('/api/transactions', requireRole(['admin', 'analyst']));
```

**API Architecture**: RESTful design principles with resource-based URL structures, appropriate HTTP method utilization, consistent response formats, and comprehensive error handling that provides meaningful feedback while maintaining security.

## 6.5 Machine Learning Integration

The ML component integrates the four unsupervised learning algorithms from Chapter 3 (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Local Outlier Factor, and Elliptic Envelope) into the fraud detection system for real-time transaction analysis.

### 6.5.1 Implementation Architecture

**ML Service Structure**: Python-based service using Scikit-learn 1.3 with FastAPI for RESTful integration. Each algorithm implemented as separate module with standardized interface for easy combination and testing.
