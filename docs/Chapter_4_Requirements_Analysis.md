# Chapter 4: Requirements Analysis

This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of the requirements for the artificial intelligence-powered fraud detection system for Malawi's mobile money ecosystem. The analysis translates stakeholder needs and operational constraints into specific technical requirements that guide system design and implementation decisions.

## 4.1 Introduction

Requirements analysis serves as the critical bridge between stakeholder needs and technical implementation by systematically identifying, documenting, and validating the specific capabilities that the fraud detection system must provide to address mobile money fraud challenges in Malawi. This process ensures that the developed system meets operational needs while maintaining technical feasibility and regulatory compliance.

The requirements analysis process employed multiple data collection techniques including stakeholder interviews, process observation, document analysis, and focus group discussions to capture comprehensive understanding of current fraud detection workflows, system limitations, and desired improvements. The analysis translates these insights into specific functional and non-functional requirements that define system behavior, performance characteristics, and operational constraints.

The requirements specification provides the foundation for system architecture design, component development, testing procedures, and acceptance criteria that ensure the final system delivers the intended value to mobile money operators, fraud investigators, and regulatory authorities. The analysis emphasizes traceability between stakeholder needs and technical requirements to ensure comprehensive coverage of operational requirements while maintaining focus on practical implementation considerations.

## 4.2 Business Process Analysis

The business process analysis examines current fraud detection workflows employed by mobile money operators in Malawi to identify process inefficiencies, system integration points, and improvement opportunities that inform system requirements definition.

### 4.2.1 Current Fraud Detection Process

The existing fraud detection process follows a reactive approach that begins with automated rule-based transaction monitoring that generates alerts based on predefined thresholds and criteria. These alerts are queued for manual investigation by fraud analysts who review transaction details, user history, and contextual information to determine fraud likelihood.

Investigation procedures involve multiple manual steps including transaction pattern analysis, user behavior assessment, geographic consistency verification, and communication with affected users or agents to gather additional information. Confirmed fraud cases require documentation, evidence compilation, case escalation to appropriate authorities, and implementation of protective measures such as account restrictions or transaction reversals.

The current process demonstrates significant inefficiencies including high false positive rates that consume investigation resources, delayed detection that allows fraudulent transactions to complete, inconsistent investigation procedures that vary between analysts, and limited integration between detection systems and case management tools.

### 4.2.2 Proposed Process Improvements

The artificial intelligence-powered fraud detection system introduces significant process improvements through real-time transaction analysis that provides immediate fraud risk assessment, automated case prioritization based on risk scores and business impact, integrated investigation workflows that streamline evidence gathering and case documentation, and comprehensive audit trails that support regulatory compliance and performance analysis.

The improved process enables proactive fraud prevention through immediate transaction blocking or additional verification requirements for high-risk transactions, reducing the window of opportunity for successful fraud completion. Automated risk scoring and case prioritization ensure that investigation resources focus on the highest-priority cases while routine low-risk alerts receive appropriate but efficient processing.
