# Fraud Detection Model Training Report

## Executive Summary

- **Training Date**: 2025-09-05 18:05:30
- **Best Model**: Elliptic Envelope
- **Training Data Size**: 200,000 transactions

## Why Unsupervised Learning?

- Real-world fraud detection lacks reliable ground truth labels
- Fraud patterns evolve rapidly, making supervised learning quickly outdated
- Unsupervised methods can detect novel, previously unknown fraud patterns
- Reduces dependency on potentially biased historical fraud classifications
- Better suited for detecting zero-day fraud attacks and emerging threats
